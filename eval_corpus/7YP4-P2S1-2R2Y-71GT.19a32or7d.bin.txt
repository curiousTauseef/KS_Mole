New owners, old spice: Rotten Apple keeps regulars' faves, brews



Jun. 12--GRAFTON -- The Rotten Apple's new owners are sticking with the restaurant's usual method of operation for now.
"People really enjoy the red beans and rice and the gumbo," said the Rotten Apple Restaurant and Ciderhouse's new manager, Tim Nesbit, who owns a small portion of the business. "We lowered some prices."

The Rotten Apple Restaurant and Ciderhouse, previously owned by Jesse Jones of Alton, who established the Cajun-inspired hangout at 220 W. Main St. in Grafton, now is primarily owned by St. Louisan Scott Clark. Jones still owns the building but sold the business several months ago. Clark and Nesbit made few changes since they took over but plan to increase outside grilling.
"We're adding a simple outdoor cafe with chicken kabobs, pulled pork, Cajun brats, stuff that people get fast, to go," said Nesbit, who splits time between Grafton and his home in Webster Groves, Mo.
Nesbit will continue crawfish boils on weekends through the fall.
The outdoor grill will feature its own outside menu, which will be ready for the public this year.
"We're reorganizing, adding more seats, space, tweaking menus," Nesbit said.
Nesbit expanded the bar's liquor selection, which includes all the libations for most mixed drinks.
"We still have all the great beers but now have a whole line of vodka and tons of different tequilas," he said.
